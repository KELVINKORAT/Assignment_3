Shortest Route Problem

Problem Statement: 

Given a set of cities and distances between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

The algorithm should take as input the number of cities, distance between all permutations of cities and give the shortest route as the output.
